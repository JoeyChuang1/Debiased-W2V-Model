This folder contains W2V model implemented from scratch 
-> Implemented and compared two word embedding models, Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) and Skip-gram
• Evaluated gender bias in GloVe embeddings (glove.6B) using WEAT method and gender subspace analysis for
career-related words.
• Implemented a debiasing technique (hard debiasing) to mitigate bias in career word embeddings, promoting fairer
representation in the model.
